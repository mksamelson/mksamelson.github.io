I'm a data scientist and quantitative analyst with a capital markets background. I love team leadership, problem solving, and getting my hands "dirty" analyzing data. Deep domain knowledge in banking, brokerage, and asset management with interests beyond. Trained as an MBA so see issues through a business lens.  Passionate about "hands-on" problem solving using statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and visualization.
