I'm a data scientist and quantitative analyst with a capital markets background.

I love team leadership, problem solving, and getting my hands dirty analyzing data. Passionate about "hands-on" problem solving using statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and visualization.

I have deep domain knowledge in banking, brokerage, and asset management and interests in other industries. Trained as an MBA, I see issues in business context and bring analytic solutions to gain insight and meet challenges.
