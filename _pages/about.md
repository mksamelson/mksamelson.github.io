I'm a senior data scientist and quantitative analyst with a capital markets background.

I love problem solving, team leadership and getting my hands dirty analyzing data. I'm passionate about "hands-on" problem solving using statistical analysis, predictive analytics, and visualization.

I have deep domain knowledge in investment management, banking, brokerage with interests in performance improvement in other industries.

Trained as an MBA, I see issues in business context and bring analytic solutions to gain insight and meet challenges.
