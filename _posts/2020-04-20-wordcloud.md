excerpt:  #"Politicians' most used words can elicit themes without listening
to an entire press conference."

Hear a speech.  Watch a press conference.

What is that politician saying?

The era of isolation and COVID-19 provides a fascinating
environment for a bit of research.

# Word Clouds #

Word clouds can provide interesting and fun insight intention
what a politician is saying.  These are quite effective
when high-level, thematic extraction is desired.  Want to
know what they are saying in a snap?  Use a word cloud.

A word cloud is a visual representation of words arranged
artistically in close proximity. The size of each word's type
is proportional to the word's frequency.

A word cloud doesn't provide *sentiment* -  the emotional
significance of the briefing as distinct from its verbal
content.

If we assume word usage is correlated with message (a reasonable
but unscientific assumption), we can get a snapshot of message
at a glance as opposed to listening to a press briefing transcript
for 10 minutes.

## Corona Virus Briefings ##

The current pandemic provides an interesting backdrop against which
to compare politician messages.  The national emergency provides
a scenario in which state and national leaders are largely discussing
the same things on a relatively frequent basis.  News broadcasts suggest
that different elected officials have different messages.

Creating word clouds from briefing transcripts provides an immediate
snapshot of speaker message.

distinctly shows - a word salad.

Having watched this briefing live as well as several others, Trump's messaging
has been largely that of a cheerleader.  Things and people are "great".  To
convey this message many adverbs are used ("really").  Auxiliary verbs such
("would") are also employed that express desire and wish.  

Note the virtual cornucopia of mixed ambiguous words: "look, great, say,
thing, people".  Not much there.  It matches his stream of speech that
leaves many views scratching their heads saying "what did he just say?"

### New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ###

Governor Cuomo, like President Trump, conducts daily Corona Virus updates.  Media reports suggest that the Governor enjoys considerable viewer confidence during this national emergency.  

The Governor spends the bulk of his briefing discussing
