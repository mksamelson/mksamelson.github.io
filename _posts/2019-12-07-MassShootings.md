## Mass Shootings Are High Profile But Should Not Be Central To The Gun Debate

Gun issues in the United States are contentious and polarizing.  Passion runs high for both proponents and opponents of gun control.  In a social climate in which the consequences for misrepresentation and egregious distortion are few, individuals on both sides speak freely on principal and not from holistic data evaluation.

Gun event data is sparse and the quality limited.  There has been no government-sponsored research (a-la CDC, etc.) for decades.  This is largely due to politics.  That said, there is crowd-sourced data on the internet.  There is no denying that gun related deaths and injuries occur daily in the United States.

Mother Jones Magazine, a liberally-oriented investigative journalism publication, has published numerous articles on "mass shootings."   There is no universally accepted definition of a Mass Shooting in the gun debate.  Generally speaking,  Mass Shootings involve a high level of victims.  Mother Jones defines a Mass Shooting as an event with 4 or more fatalities.

Mother Jones Magazine was challenged by activists in response to assertions made in several articles.  In response, the magazine made it's data publicly available.

This analysis focuses on understand and attempting to elicit statistical significance from the Mother Jones data.
