Hear a speech.  Watch a press conference.

What is that politician saying?

The era of isolation and COVID-19 provides a fascinating
environment for a bit of research.

# Word Clouds #

Word clouds can provide interesting and fun insight intention
what a politician is saying.  These are quite effective
when high-level, thematic extraction is desired.  Want to
know what they are saying in a snap?  Use a word cloud.

A word cloud is a visual representation of words arranged
artistically in close proximity. The size of each word's type
is proportional to the word's frequency.

A word cloud doesn't provide *sentiment* -  the emotional
significance of the briefing as distinct from its verbal
content.

If we assume word usage is correlated with message (a reasonable
but unscientific assumption), we can get a snapshot of message
at a glance as opposed to listening to a press briefing transcript
for 10 minutes.

## Corona Virus Briefings ##

The current pandemic provides an interesting backdrop against which
to compare politician messages.  The national emergency provides
a scenario in which state and national leaders are largely discussing
the same things on a relatively frequent basis.  News broadcasts suggest
that different elected officials have different messages.

Creating word clouds from briefing transcripts provides an immediate
snapshot of speaker message.

### President Donald Trump ###

A look at the word cloud from President Trump's April 20th Corona Virus update
distinctly shows - a word salad.

Having watched this briefing live as well as several others, Trump's messaging
has been largely that of a cheerleader.  Things and people are "great".  To
convey this message many adverbs are used ("really").  Auxiliary verbs such
("would") are also employed that express desire and wish.  

Note the virtual cornucopia of mixed ambiguous words: "look, great, say,
thing, people".  Not much there.  It matches his stream of speech that
leaves many views scratching their heads saying "what did he just say?"

### New York Governor Andrew Cuomo ###

Governor Cuomo, like President Trump, conducts daily Corona Virus updates.  Media reports suggest that the Governor enjoys considerable viewer confidence during this national emergency.  

The Governor spends the bulk of his briefing granularly discussing New York
State's efforts to combat the virus.   Subject matter - broadly speaking from
having watched his briefings - falls into three categories:

* The need to test for the Virus
* Challenges in getting Federal Government assistance to effectively combat the virus.
* Exploring citizens to heed state and local government social guidance.

Sure enough, the word cloud for Governor Cuomo's April 20th corona virus update
far and away emphasizes "test" and "people" in terms of usage. "State" and
"government" are also repetitively used to a lesser but notable extent.

### Georgia Governor Brian Kemp ###

Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, at the time of this writing, has decided to begin
reopening the selected businesses in the state of Georgia.  This has received
considerable pushback from medical professionals and even President Trump (who, curiously,
was all for re-opening the economy the prior week.)

Notably, the Kemp word cloud has several words which capture the tone of his briefing:  
The "state", "work", "people", "Georgia", "health".

However, the word cloud *misses* the suscint announcement that Georgia will allow
the selective opening of designated business - clearly the central point of this
particular update.  This highlights the way frequency word clouds can and can't be
used.
