Customer retention is critical for all businesses.  Customers are the primary source of company revenue and
have a direct impact on the bottom line. Understanding engagement - and better yet being able to predict
engagement - can be particularly helpful to intercede in issues **before** they become problems.

In this post we examine three months of real pre-paid phone card data and develop a model to predict
customers who will drop the service in the fourth month.

# The Data

The data set consists of three months of pre-paid phone card data from June through August 2013.  There
are approximately 65,000 observations reflecting individual customers and 65 features.  The objective
is to use the June, July, and August customer data to predict customers who will drop the service in
September.
